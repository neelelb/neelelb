### Hi all! 
I'm Neele 👩🏻‍💻 and this is what I'm up to right now:

- 🎓 PhD-student in cognitive neuroscience at Hamburg University
- 📍 currently studying the effect of prediction errors on memory with a focus on replay in humans
- 🧠 finished my master's at FU Berlin & wrote my thesis at the NeuroCode Research Group at Max-Planck-Institute Berlin
- 🌱 learning to code mainly in python (and rarely R)
