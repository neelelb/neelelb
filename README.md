### Hi all! 
It's me, Neele 👩🏻‍💻 and this is what I'm up to right now:

- 🎓 student in cognitive neuroscience at FU Berlin
- 🧠 writing my master thesis with the NeuroCode Research Group at Max-Planck-Institute Berlin
- 📍 currently on my exchange semester @University of Melbourne: studying Bayesian Statistical Learning
- 🌱 learning to code mainly in python, but also R and MATLAB
